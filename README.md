# Jack Compiler
Jack Compiler is a *two-tier* compiler made from scratch with python which implements a basic Object-Oriented Language named Jack. Jack language is a simple and a primitive programming language, which was made scratch for a 16-bit architecture called Hack PC which is a project of the course Nand2Tetris. This project is extending the implementations of Jack Language.

# Getting Started
  These instructions will get you a copy of the compiler on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
  What are the requirements inorder to develop the Jack language.

`python 3.6.*`

`VM Emulator (which you can find in the [**tools**]( /tools/) directory.`

# Running the tests

  While running tests on the compiler follow these steps.

# Compile the code using the compiler

  ``` bash
      $ python3 JackCompiler.py /path/to/the/Jack_file(or) directory
  ```

  Once a Jack file is compiled a file with same name with extension `.vm` is created, which is the VM code
  which can be run on the VMEmulator that is supplied in tools.
  
  **Running a VM file in a VM Emulator**
  
   Windows
  
    cd "PATH\ TO \ JackCompiler \ tools \ " VMEmulator.bat
  
   Linux
  
    
    cd /PATH/ TO /JackCompiler/ tools
    ./VMEmulator.sh
